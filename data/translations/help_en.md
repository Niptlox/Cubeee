The concept of the game; gas giant, when descending to the core, magnetic and gas 
storms intensify, new enemies and anomalies appear, damage is inflicted on the 
hero and snarr, the lower boundary of the world is impassable turbolent clouds.
People went to the core through an anomaly, a late-level location.
A brief history of the world:
Intelligent life flourished peacefully for many millennia, until the servants 
of the dark cult, for the sake of consolidating personal power, called the dark god,
who forever changed the planet into what it is now, the majority of the population 
died out, and the remaining cultists went to the core under the protection of clouds 
to serve the dark god forever.
